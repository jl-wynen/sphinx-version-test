- copy settings in conf.py
- copy action and settings in docs.yml
- init gh-pages branch by running the action once (might fail because there are no current versions)
- add .nojekyll
- add a 'latest' folder which redirects to base (which redirects to latest version)
- style switcher
- put versions into en/1.0 etc (seems to be what RTD does)
